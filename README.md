# Rust tutorial

Iam making this repository based on "The Rust Programming Language" book.

I added some codes for better understanding of concepts & to be more fun!

I recommend using this repo to those who already are familiar to   C++ concepts like:
* pointer & its safety issues (dangling pointer)
* memory (heap & stack)
* RAII pattern
* copy & move semantic  

These projects are based on Rust 1.81.0 (released 2024-09-04)
